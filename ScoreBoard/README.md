<h1>Score Board Program for Southern Cross</h1>
This was one of my first attempts at writing a program on the Southern Cross.  
The program keeps track of the score of 2 different players using the left 4 digits of the 7 segment displays.
The left two digits are for the first player, and the right two digits are for the second player.
+/- increases and decreases the score for player 1.
B/F increases and decreases the score for player 2.
The score board will roll over past 99, but will not decrease below zero.
