<h1>Blink Program for the Southern Cross</h1>
This program is used with an I/O module that you create:
https://bryceautomation.com/index.php/2023/07/31/i-o-module-for-the-southern-cross/
<p>Binary output module address is 80H, and the input address is 81H</p>

<p>All lights will blink, and the switches determine the blink rate. With all switches off, the blink will be barely noticeable.  As you turn on switches from the 
right to left, the delay loop will begin to slow.</p>  <p>
