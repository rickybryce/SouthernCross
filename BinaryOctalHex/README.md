<h1>Binary, Octal, and Hex Counter</h1>
This program will display Octal on the first 4 digits of the Southern Cross display.  Hexadecimal will be displayed on the rightmodst two digits of the display.  
If you have an I/O module built, you can use the switches to set the high byte of the delay loop.  ie: switch 0 will be slow, switch 1 is slower, and switch 7 is the slowest.

<p>
  The counter will run from 0 to FF Hex, 0 to 377 octal, and the binary equivalent on an LED display.


<h2>BinaryOctalHex.asm</h2>
BinaryOctalHex requires the I/O module, and will display binary on your LED's, Octal and Hex on the display.

<h2>OctalHexOnly.asm</h2>
OctalHexOnly will display binary and hex values on the display. Use this file if you do not have an I/O Moudle.
You can only adjust the delay in the code.<p>
