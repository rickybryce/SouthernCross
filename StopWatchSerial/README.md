<h1>StopWatchSerial</h1>
<p>This project is a stop watch for the Southern Cross by Craig Jones.  It requires the SCNEO ROM with a serial card.</p>
<p>+ (on the keypad) will start the stopwatch, and - on the keypad pauses.  0 on the keypad resets the stop watch to zero. </p>
<p>You can calibrate the stop watch by adding NOPS to the delay routine.  I've tested this to 10 minutes.</p>
