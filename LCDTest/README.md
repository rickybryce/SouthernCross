<h1>LCD Test Program for Southern Cross</h1>
<p>This is a simple test program for an LCD Module on the Southern Cross Computer, which is designed by Craig Jones.</p>
<p>The purpose of this file is to test your display once you have it built.  It also acts as an example of how the 20x4 display can be configured.</p>
<p>This program is set up for an LCD module with Port 50H as the command port, and 51H as the data port.</p>
<p>If you use Z80ASM by SLR systems (1982), simply change the filename extension from .ASM to .Z80 before assembling.
