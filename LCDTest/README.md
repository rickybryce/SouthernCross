<h1>LCD Test Program for Southern Cross</h1>
<p>This is a simple test program for an LCD Module on the Southern Cross Computer by Craig Jones.</p>
<p>The purpose of this file is to test your display once you have it built, and is an example of how the 20x4 display can be configured.</p>
<p>This program is set up for an LCD module with Port 50H as the command port, and 51H as the data port.</p>
